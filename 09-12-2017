Q3 Recycling on elements in a vector?
When applying an operation to two vectors that requires them to be the same length, R automatically recycles, or repeats, 
the shorter one, until it is long enough to match the longer one.


Q4 Example of Recycle of Vector?
Here is an example:

> c(1,2,4) + c(6,0,9,20,22)
[1]  7  2 13 21 24

Warning message:
longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length in: c(1, 2, 4) + c(6, 0, 9, 20, 22)

The shorter vector was recycled, so the operation was taken to be as follows:
> c(1,2,4,1,2) + c(6,0,9,20,22)
